Understand this concept properly.

Big-0 : Big 0 Notation gives the upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, Helping to quantify performance
        as the input size becomes arbitrarily large.

Omega - lower bound

theta - tight bound

Classic Exmaples:

Finding all subsets of a set - O(2^n)
Finding all permutations - O(n!)
Sorting using merge sort - O(nlog(n))
Iterating over all the cells in a matrix of size n by m - O(nm)


Space complexity:

Create an array on n size - O(n);
Create an 2d array of n*n - O(n^2);
create a recursion (call stack) - O(n);
No Data structure - O(1);


Note:
Sidawdze gets halved - most likely O(log n).
