Design Pattern:

### Singleton: Ensures only one instance of the class is created.
public class SingleObject {

   //create an object of SingleObject
   private static SingleObject instance = new SingleObject();

   //make the constructor private so that this class cannot be
   //instantiated
   private SingleObject(){}

   //Get the only object available
   public static SingleObject getInstance(){
      return instance;
   }


### MVC

Model: All data related logic
View : UI logical
Controller: Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to
 process all the business logic and incoming requests, manipulate data using the
  Model component and interact with the Views to render the final output
